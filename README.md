# Is Taylor Swift Single App

This app is an example of how to write an android application in groovy. It provides examples
of how to use dagger (as well as other annotation processors), create extension methods, and
how to setup custom compilation configurations.


Big thanks to @peterhajas for providing the json data, and thanks to @melix for getting
groovy to run on Android.
